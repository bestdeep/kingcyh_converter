- HPRP
How should HPRP winners be set?
Or should the chain automatically set them according to its own logic?
I am considering whether the backend and the chain should communicate in real time.
If so, there may be a communication overhead.
And when should the HPRP winners' rewards be sent?
So, does this mean that the chain should pseudorandomly select a winner?
That is, I should use current block hash and latest block hash?
Then I will generate a pseudorandom number based on the block hash in the chain.

The backend should communicate in realtime.
We will use the controller to activate the selection of a winner quarterly.

- And when should chain set whitelistEnabled?
That is a feature that should be able to be enabled and disabled from .the backend controller as needed by staff.
- Market Open&Close
Pay attention to market open and market close.
Feature that has to be there as well.
