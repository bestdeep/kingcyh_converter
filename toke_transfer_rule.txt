1. Token transfer rules
- If the sender or receiver belongs to EXCLUDEPRICECHECK, transfer as is, ignore everything else.
- If the WHITELIST function is activated, token transfer is not possible if the sender or receiver does not belong to the WHITELIST.
- A token transfer time interval is set for the same sender.
- If the sender or receiver belongs to the BLACKLIST, token transfer is not possible.
- If the sender or receiver is a BMP violator, a penalty fee must be transferred to the HPRP POOL in order to transfer tokens. This is an additional fee.
- If the current market price of the token is lower than the BMP, token transfer is not possible.
